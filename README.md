# integration-theory-VT23
Repository for integration theory MATP39 in Lund, VT23. The project was to present the integral presented in the paper “Henstock-Kurzweil integral on BV
sets” (2016) by Malý and Pfeffer.
It includes a project presentation (Presentation/...) and a project report (Report/...). Note that this is still work in progress.

## TODO
- show that squares are epsilon-isoparametric

- add something to isoperimetric?
- what is the isoparametricity used for?
- mention properties like positivity of the integral.
- add image of proof
- discuss surface measure of a cube
- add Henstock-Kurzweil extension?
- add conclusion
